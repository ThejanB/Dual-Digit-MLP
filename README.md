# DualDigitMLP

## Introduction
DualDigitMLP is a project aimed at constructing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch to perform binary classification of handwritten digits. This repository explores building a neural network model to classify images containing digits specifically chosen from the MNIST dataset. The focus is on understanding and implementing the foundational elements of neural networks without relying on high-level machine learning frameworks.

## Project Overview
The model is designed to classify two particular digits from the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits. This project could be expanded or adapted to other pairs of digits or more complex classification tasks.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to gain a deeper understanding of neural networks by implementing a basic MLP model from scratch. This hands-on approach helps in grasping the intricate details of neural network operations, weight updates, and classification processes.
